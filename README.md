# About this Repo

This is the docker image that is used to run ci-tests for mailman using
Gitlab-CI. We use `docker` system to run tests inside the containers built
from this image. For more information on how to use [gitlab-ci-multi-runner][1],
refer to [this][2] documentation.

## How to build?

To build this image run:

```bash
$ docker build -t mailman-runner .
```

## Images

There are two images published from this repo,

```
$ docker pull ghcr.io/maxking/mailman-ci-runner:master
```

and 
```
$ docker pull ghcr.io/maxking/mailman-ci-runner-falcon:master
```

The 2nd image, with `-falcon` suffix run as `USER root` since Github Actions
does not allow usage of images running as non-root users. The source for
both the images is the same [Dockerfile](Dockerfile), but for `-falcon`
we append a `USER root` to the Dockerfile in CI.

## How to use this image?

Just add the line `image: ghcr.io/maxking/mailman-ci-runner` to the top of your
`.gitlab-ci.yml` file (or, if you are using a different CI system, you can use the
right config according to them). This will make sure this docker image is used to execute
the tests. You can either use Gitlab's shared runners or deploy your own
`gitlab-ci-multi-runner`. Please refer to Gitlab's documentation on how to
deploy and configure it yourself.
